// pipeline agents 
agent(control where to execute my stages in any executors,  ) any means --- automatically scales and executes there based on load 
    - any: 

    we can define agents at stage level as well

If i want to decide the agents at stage level then we have to give agent none at pipeline level, agent at every stage
